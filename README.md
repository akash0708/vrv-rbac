## Project Overview

This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard** designed to manage user roles and permissions effectively. It features three types of users: **Superadmin**, **Admin**, and **User**, each with specific privileges:

- **Superadmin**:

  - Manage all users (edit roles, block/unblock, delete).
  - Promote/demote users to/from Admin.
  - Full control over the system.

- **Admin**:

  - Approve or reject user applications.
  - View and manage user statuses (but cannot manage other Admins or Superadmins).

- **User**:
  - Register and participate in events or activities.
  - Limited access to application features.

### Key Features

1. **User Management**:

   - View a list of all users with their details (name, email, role, status).
   - Promote/demote users between roles (e.g., User â†’ Admin).
   - Block or unblock users.

2. **Access Control**:

   - Implement fine-grained role-based access control to restrict actions based on roles.

3. **Dynamic Role Updates**:

   - Update roles dynamically with instant UI feedback.

4. **Real-Time Notifications**:

   - Visual feedback for actions like role updates or user blocking.

5. **Scalable Architecture**:
   - Built with modern technologies including **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **NeonDB** for seamless performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js**:  
  Utilized for building a fast and efficient React-based frontend with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **Shadcn Components**:  
  For creating accessible, customizable, and reusable UI components that ensure consistency across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**:  
  A utility-first CSS framework for styling, enabling rapid and responsive UI development.
- **Aceternity UI**:  
  Integrated to provide clean and modern and performant animations to bring the website to life.

### Backend

- **Prisma**:  
  ORM used to manage database schemas and streamline data access.
- **PostgreSQL (via NeonDB)**:  
  A robust relational database for storing and managing application data efficiently.

## Future plans

While the current implementation of the project provides basic roles (User, Admin, and Superadmin), there are plans to expand the functionality to allow for more flexibility in role management.

One of the main features to be added is the ability to create and manage custom roles. This will allow administrators or superadmins to define roles with specific permissions tailored to the needs of the organization.
