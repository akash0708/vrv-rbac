# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard** designed to manage user roles and permissions effectively. It features three types of users: **Superadmin**, **Admin**, and **User**, each with specific privileges:

- **Superadmin**:

  - Manage all users (edit roles, block/unblock, delete).
  - Promote/demote users to/from Admin.
  - Full control over the system.

- **Admin**:

  - Approve or reject user applications.
  - View and manage user statuses (but cannot manage other Admins or Superadmins).

- **User**:
  - Register and participate in events or activities.
  - Limited access to application features.

### Key Features

1. **User Management**:

   - View a list of all users with their details (name, email, role, status).
   - Promote/demote users between roles (e.g., User â†’ Admin).
   - Block or unblock users.

2. **Access Control**:

   - Implement fine-grained role-based access control to restrict actions based on roles.

3. **Dynamic Role Updates**:

   - Update roles dynamically with instant UI feedback.

4. **Real-Time Notifications**:

   - Visual feedback for actions like role updates or user blocking.

5. **Scalable Architecture**:
   - Built with modern technologies including **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **NeonDB** for seamless performance and scalability.
